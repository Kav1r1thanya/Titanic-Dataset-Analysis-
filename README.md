Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) are critical steps in the data science workflow. Data cleaning involves preparing raw data for analysis by handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing inconsistencies. This step ensures that the data is accurate, consistent, and suitable for analysis.

Exploratory data analysis, on the other hand, involves summarizing the main characteristics of the data, often using visual methods. EDA helps to uncover patterns, spot anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions with the help of statistical graphics and other data visualization techniques. By performing EDA, we can understand the underlying structure of the data, identify important variables, and guide further analysis or modeling efforts.

In this analysis, we will utilize the Titanic dataset to demonstrate these processes. This dataset provides information about the passengers on the Titanic, including variables such as age, gender, and survival status. Through data cleaning and EDA, we will explore the relationships between these variables and identify key patterns and trends.
